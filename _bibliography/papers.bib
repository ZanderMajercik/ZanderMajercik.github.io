abstract = {We present a near-eye augmented reality display with resolution and focal depth dynamically driven by gaze tracking. The display combines a traveling microdisplay relayed off a concave half-mirror magnifier for the high-resolution foveal region, with a wide field-of-view peripheral display using a projector-based Maxwellian-view display whose nodal point is translated to follow the viewer's pupil during eye movements using a traveling holographic optical element. The same optics relay an image of the eye to an infrared camera used for gaze tracking, which in turn drives the foveal display location and peripheral nodal point. Our display supports accommodation cues by varying the focal depth of the microdisplay in the foveal region, and by rendering simulated defocus on the "always in focus" scanning laser projector used for peripheral display. The resulting family of displays significantly improves on the field-of-view, resolution, and form-factor tradeoff present in previous augmented reality designs. We show prototypes supporting 30, 40 and 60 cpd foveal resolution at a net 85° \texttimes{} 78° field of view per eye.},

abstract = {Abstract Interactive global illumination remains a challenge in radiometrically and geometrically complex scenes. Specialized sampling strategies are effective for specular and near-specular transport because the scattering has relatively low directional variance per scattering event. In contrast, the high variance from transport paths comprising multiple rough glossy or diffuse scattering events remains notoriously difficult to resolve with a small number of samples. We extend unidirectional path tracing to address this by combining screen-space reservoir resampling and sparse world-space probes, significantly improving sample efficiency for transport contributions that terminate on diffuse scattering events. Our experiments demonstrate a clear improvement—at equal time and equal quality—over purely path traced and purely probe-based baselines. Moreover, when combined with commodity denoisers, we are able to interactively render global illumination in complex scenes.},
